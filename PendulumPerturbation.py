"""
Pendulum_Perturbation.py is a script that does analysis on a double pendulum,
specifically on the divergence in trajectories for double pendulums with similar
but slightly varying initial conditions.

This code is split into three sections.

    (0) simulation settings
        a chunk of code dedicated to simulation settings that are global
        throughout the entire script
        
    (1) numerical computation
        a chunk of code dedicated to the numerical computation of 
        double pendulum trajectories    
    
    (2) analytics
        a chunk of code dedicated to running analytics on the computations,
        e.g. lyapunov exponent, chaos measurements, etc
        
    (3) plotting algorithm
        a chunk of code dedicated to creating visual representations of the
        various double pendulum trajectories in an aesthetically-pleasing
        realtime plot format.
